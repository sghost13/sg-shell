#Config files for bash and zsh

 - This currently relies on a lot of scripts in $HOME/.local/bin that i have yet to include.
 - Currently trying to finalize how i want this to ship with my other dotfiles wayland/sway/hyprland.
 - Leaning towards private arch repo, this will remained in dissarray until i decide on more things.

 - See ./shell/* subfolders in this repo for better README's.
