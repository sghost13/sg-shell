ZSH is my current interactive shell.
Bash is no longer really used or maintained in regard to an interactive shell.

Shellcheck is setup for bash scripting, I follow google's style guides here: https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html


See home/.config/shell/.zshrc for the main entrypoint.
